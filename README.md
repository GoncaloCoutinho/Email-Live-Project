# Email-Live-Project
This is a LiveProject on how to think about automating mail by Manning publications.

In short, the goal was to automate an email based on a csv with student names and scores for their assignments. 
The program should send a personalized email for each student with their grades and should also warn one randomnly assigned student to do a book presentation in class.
